# Network Scanning

This repository contains planning material for a simple OSINT web application. The idea is to provide tools like `nmap`, `whois`, and DNS queries in a user-friendly interface. See `PLAN.md` for details.

## Running

Install dependencies:
```
pip install flask dnspython python-whois python-nmap
```

Start the web app:
```
python app.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.
