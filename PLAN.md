# Network Scanning Website Plan

This document outlines a high-level plan for building a small open-source intelligence (OSINT) web application that performs several network reconnaissance tasks. The tool should only be used on systems that you own or have explicit permission to test.

## Goals
- Accept an IP address or domain name from the user.
- Run a variety of passive and active reconnaissance tools:
  - `nmap` for port and service scanning.
  - `whois` for domain registration information.
  - DNS lookups using `dnspython` or system utilities.
  - URL extraction and HTTP header inspection.
  - Technology detection using a library such as `wappalyzer`.
- Display the results in a clean web interface.

## Technology Choices
- **Backend**: Python with Flask for simplicity, or Node.js with Express. The examples below assume Python.
- **Task Execution**: Each scanning step can be run using subprocess calls to command line tools or via Python libraries.
- **Frontend**: Basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript, possibly using a template engine like Jinja2 for Flask.
- **Asynchronous Jobs**: Consider using `celery` or Python's `asyncio` if scans take a long time.

## Basic Workflow
1. User submits a target IP or domain.
2. Validate the input (ensure it's a valid IP or domain).
3. Run scanning tasks sequentially or in parallel:
   - `nmap` for open ports and service banners.
   - `whois` for registrar and contact info.
   - DNS queries (`A`, `MX`, `NS`, etc.).
   - Fetch the web page and extract URLs and headers.
   - Run technology detection.
4. Collect outputs, format them, and present the results in the browser.

## Important Considerations
- **Legal and Ethical Use**: Always obtain permission before scanning systems you do not own. Unauthorized scanning may be illegal or violate terms of service.
- **Security**: Use sandboxing or containers for running third-party tools. Validate all user input and sanitize command parameters.
- **Rate Limiting**: To avoid abuse, implement limits on how often scans can be performed.
- **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages when scans fail or when an invalid target is provided.

## Example Dependencies (Python)
- `flask` – Web framework.
- `python-nmap` – Control the `nmap` executable from Python.
- `python-whois` – Parse `whois` data.
- `dnspython` – Perform DNS lookups.
- `wappalyzer` (via `py-wappalyzer`) – Technology detection.

These libraries can be installed via pip and invoked inside your Flask routes to gather OSINT data.
